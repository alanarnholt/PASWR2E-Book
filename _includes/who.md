      <p><strong>Academic Researchers</strong>: This book is intended to be a practical guide for how to actually make your research reproducible. Even if you already use tools such as R and LaTeX you may not be leveraging their full potential. This book will teach you useful ways to get the most out of them as part of a reproducible research workflow.</p>

    <div class="span3 offset1">
      <p><strong>Students</strong>: Upper-level undergraduate and graduate students conducting original computational research should make your research reproducible. Forcing yourself to clearly document the steps you took will also encourage you to think more clearly about what you are doing and reinforce what you are learning. It will hopefully give you a greater appreciation of research accountability and integrity early in your career.</p>

      <p><strong>Instructors</strong>: When instructors incorporate the tools of reproducible research into their assignments they not only build students’ understanding of research best practice, but are also better able to evaluate and provide meaningful feedback on students’ work. This book provides a resource that you can use with students to put reproducibility into practice.</p>

      <p><strong>Editors</strong>: Beyond a lack of reproducible research skills among researchers, an impediment to actually creating reproducible research is a lack of infrastructure to publish it. Hopefully, this book will be useful for editors at academic publishers who want to be better at evaluating reproducible research, editing it, and developing systems to make it more widely available.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="span3 offset5">
      <p><strong>Private Sector Researchers</strong>: Researchers in the private sector may or may not want to make their work easily reproducible outside of their organization. However, that does not mean that significant benefits cannot be gained from using the methods of reproducible research. Making your research reproducible to members of your organization can spread valuable information about how analyses were done and data was collected. This will help build your organization’s knowledge and avoid effort duplication. </p>
