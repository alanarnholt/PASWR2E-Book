      <p><a href="http://www.r-project.org/">R</a>: a programming language primarily for statistics and graphics. We will focus on using it for dynamic data gathering and presenting results.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="span3 offset1">
      <p><a href="http://yihui.name/knitr/">knitr</a>: an R package for literate programming, i.e. it allows you to combine your statistical analysis and the presentation of the results into one document. It works with R and a number of other languages such as Bash, Python, and Ruby.</p>

      <p><strong>Unix-like shell programs</strong>: These tools are useful for working with large research projects. They also allow us to use command line tools including <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/">GNU Make</a> for compiling projects and <a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/">Pandoc</a>, a program useful for converting documents from one markup language to another.</p>
