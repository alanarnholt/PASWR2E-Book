      <p class="lead"><em>Practical and Visually Appealing with Clear Examples and Fully Detailed Proofs</em></p>
      <blockquote><strong>{{ site.title }}</strong> shows how to solve various statistical problems using both parametric and nonparametric techniques via the open source software R.  It provides numerous real-world examples, carefully explained proofs, end-of-chapter problems, and illuminating graphs to facilitate the hands-on comprehension.</blockquote>

      <p class="lead"><em>Delves into Many Probability and Statistical Topics</em></p>
      <blockquote>Integrating theory with practice, the text briefly introduces the syntax, structures, and functions of the R language, before covering important graphical and numerical methods of exploring data.  The package <code>ggplot2</code> is used throughout the book to create graphs.  The next several chapters elucidate probability and random variables topics, including univariate and multivariate distributions.  After exploring sampling distributions, the authors discuss point estimation, confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, and a wide range of nonparametric methods, spotlighting the bootstrap and permutation tests.  The book also presents fixed- and random-effects models as well as randomized block and two-factor factorial designs in a chapter on experimental design.  The final chapter describes simple and multiple regression analyses with an emphasis on model validation.</blockquote>
