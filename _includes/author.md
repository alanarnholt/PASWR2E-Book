      <p>I am a Research Fellow at the <a href="http://www.hertie-school.org/facultyandresearch/research-centres/research-centres/fiscal-governance-centre/">Fiscal Governance Centre, Hertie School of Governance</a>. My <a href="http://christophergandrud.blogspot.kr/p/research.html">research</a> focuses on the international political economy of public financial and monetary institutions, as well as applied social science statistics. My work has been published in the <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrip20">Review of International Political Economy</a> and the <a href="http://ips.sagepub.com/">International Political Science Review</a>.</p>

      <p>I have been a lecturer at <a href="http://www.yonsei.ac.kr/eng/">Yonsei University</a> and a Fellow in Government at the <a href="http://www2.lse.ac.uk/home.aspx">London School of Economics</a>. In 2012 I completed a PhD in political science and quantitative methods at LSE.</p>

      <p>When I stumble upon a tool that helps me do research better I share it on my <a href="http://christophergandrud.blogspot.com/">blog</a> or on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/ChrisGandrud">@ChrisGandrud</a>. </p>
